# what_should_i_do
A starter web app for indecisiveness. 
Overview
The Decision Maker is a Django-based web application designed to help users make choices from predefined categories such as restaurants, games, movies, or activities. Users can also add their own options and use a coin toss feature for random decision-making.

This project was created as part of a class assignment to demonstrate proficiency in web application development using Django.

Features
Browse Categories: View options grouped by categories like Restaurants, Games, Movies, and Activities.
Add New Options: Extend categories with your own choices.
Coin Toss Tool: Get a randomized decision with a virtual coin toss.


Here's an updated Bug List section for your README file based on the issues you mentioned:

Bug List
Coin Toss CSS Issues:
The styling for the coin toss page is inconsistent. The CSS does not apply correctly.

"Add Option" Functionality:
The "Add Option" feature does not work as expected. User submissions do not update the database, and no options are saved.

General CSS Inconsistencies:
Pages within the app occasionally display with inconsistent styles.

Hardcoded Categories:
Current implementation uses hardcoded categories, limiting user flexibility. Users cannot create or delete categories dynamically.
